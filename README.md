SNES Assembly Code by krom (Peter Lemon).<br />
<br />
All code compiles out of box with the bass (v14) assembler by byuu.<br />
I use a special version of bass by ARM9 which has been updated with SuperFX/GSU Risc output:<br />
https://github.com/ARM9/bass<br />
I have included binaries of all the demos.<br />
<br />
Special thanks to byuu, for making the higan emulator, & the bass assembler =D<br />
Please check out higan, a cycle accurate SNES Emulator:<br />

<br />
Also thanks to ARM9, for helping me with my SNES initialisation routine, my SuperFX/GSU LIB file, & his SuperFX/GSU bass assembler.<br />
<br />
Howto Compile:<br />
All the code compiles into a single binary (ROMNAME.sfc) file.<br />
Using bass Run: make.bat<br />
<br />
Howto Run:<br />
I only test with a real SNES using a SD2SNES Cartridge by ikari:<br />

You can also use SNES emulators like higan & the MAME SNES Driver.
